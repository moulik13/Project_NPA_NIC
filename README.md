* Feature selection will be done firstly 
* scarping of data or custom data will be created in python 
* income and spending analysis will be done to see what his profit is and what's his spending (living cost on that area)
* relationship between features will be done (weather to group them or not)
* Model will be selected (ensemble learning,or something else)
* model implementation will be done and accurancy of the result will be analysed
