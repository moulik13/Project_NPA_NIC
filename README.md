# Project_NPA_NIC   
2 months internship at National informatic center (NIC)

## NPA prediction model on an INDIVIDUAL: Problem statement 
The banking sector analyse credit history of a person/organization before providing them a loan. But in the case of agriculture sector banks provide loans and the loan amount and interest does not come back to the bank. this loan then become Non-Performing Asset (NPA). Basically, it ceases the bank's income, to prevent this Generate a model by analyzing the data and the features which will predict the score of NPA of a person. This score will tell the probability of how much percentage a person will become NPA.

## Project Overview 
* Feature selection will be done first 
* scarping of data or custom data will be created in Python 
* income and spending analysis will be done to see what his profit is and what's his spending (living cost in that area)
* relationship between features will be done (whether to group them or not)
* Model will be selected (ensemble learning, or something else)
* model implementation will be done and accuracy of the result will be analyzed

## Code and Resourse used
